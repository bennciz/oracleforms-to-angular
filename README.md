# Legacy Oracle → Angular/.NET Modernization with a GenAI Migration Pipeline

🇬🇧 English | 🇫🇷 [Français](README.fr.md)

A **sample** that shows how to modernize legacy Oracle applications — **Oracle Forms** and
**Oracle APEX** — into a modern **Angular + .NET** stack on AWS, using a **generative-AI
migration pipeline** built on **Amazon Bedrock**. The pipeline reads the legacy artifacts,
recovers their business rules into a **knowledge base**, generates the target code, and
**validates behavioural equivalence** before anything ships.

## Overview

Organizations running Oracle Forms and Oracle APEX face end-of-life, security, and
skills-retention pressure, but hand-rewriting hundreds of PL/SQL-backed screens is slow and
risky. This sample demonstrates an **AI-assisted, evidence-based** approach:

- **Parse** the legacy Forms (`.fmb`) and APEX export to recover structure and business logic
  — no AI, fully deterministic.
- **Index** the recovered rules into an **Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base** (RAG) so developers
  can ask questions about the legacy system in natural language.
- **Generate** the modern Angular + .NET + OpenAPI code with **Amazon Bedrock (Anthropic
  Claude)**, preserving each recovered rule.
- **Validate** the result with generated equivalence tests and an optional live **shadow
  mode** that diffs the modern app against the legacy system on identical inputs.

The legacy inputs here are **legally-clean, public stand-in applications** (see
[The sample legacy apps](#the-sample-legacy-apps)) so the whole pipeline is reproducible by
anyone.

## Architecture

**GenAI migration pipeline**

## How It Works

| Stage | Service(s) | What it does |
|------|------------|--------------|
| **1 · Parse** | AWS Lambda (container) | Parses Oracle Forms `.fmb` binaries and the APEX export into JSON; builds a dependency graph and recovers business rules. Pure Python — no AI, runs anywhere. |
| **2 · Knowledge Base** | Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases · Amazon OpenSearch Serverless · Amazon Titan Text Embeddings v2 | Turns the recovered rules into a Markdown corpus — per-form docs, **business rules (intent + PL/SQL)**, dependency map, and schema (**not** the raw `.fmb`) — embeds it with Titan v2, and indexes it in OpenSearch Serverless for RAG with citations. See [ARCHITECTURE](ARCHITECTURE.md#what-actually-goes-into-the-knowledge-base). |
| **3 · Generate** | Amazon Bedrock (Anthropic Claude) | Generates Angular components, a .NET API, an OpenAPI spec, and tests — one file per call to avoid truncation — each recovered rule traced into the output. |
| **4 · Validate** | AWS Lambda · generated `pytest` | Runs behavioural-equivalence tests. An optional **shadow mode** runs the same inputs through the legacy system and the modern API and diffs every decision. |

The stages are orchestrated by **AWS Step Functions** (STANDARD workflow — the chained
extended-thinking Bedrock calls exceed the Express 5-minute limit). Artifacts and reports are
written to **Amazon S3**; **Amazon CloudWatch** provides observability.

## Prerequisites

- An AWS account with access to **Amazon Bedrock** models (Anthropic Claude + Amazon Titan
  Embeddings) enabled in your region.
- **AWS CLI v2**, **AWS CDK CLI** (`npm i -g aws-cdk`), **Docker**, **Node.js ≥ 18**,
  **Python ≥ 3.11**, **.NET SDK 8**.
- An Oracle database for the "before"/"after" apps. This sample targets **Oracle XE** (e.g.
  the community `gvenzl/oracle-xe:21-slim` image) — **bring your own**; no Oracle binaries are
  redistributed here.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # fill in your values
./scripts/deploy-all.sh       # (Windows: ./scripts/deploy-all.ps1)
```

`deploy-all` provisions the infrastructure, builds and pushes the .NET API container, wires
the CloudFront `/api/*` proxy, then builds and ships the Angular SPA. It prints the CloudFront
URL when done.

To run the **migration pipeline** against the bundled sample inputs, see
[`pipeline/README.md`](pipeline/README.md).

## What Gets Deployed

CDK stacks in [`infrastructure/cdk`](infrastructure/cdk):

| Stack | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `NetworkStack` | VPC, subnets, security groups, ALB |
| `SecurityStack` | IAM roles, Secrets Manager secret for the DB credential |
| `StorageStack` | S3 (frontend + artifacts), ECR repo, CloudFront distribution + `/api/*` proxy |
| `DatabaseStack` | Oracle XE on EC2 (dev/sandbox) + schema bootstrap |
| `BedrockKBStack` | Bedrock Knowledge Base + OpenSearch Serverless collection/index |
| `PipelineStack` | Step Functions state machine + Lambda-container stages |
| `ApiStack` | ECS Fargate service (the .NET API) behind the ALB |
| `ObservabilityStack` | CloudWatch dashboards/metrics |

## The Sample Legacy Apps

The pipeline's inputs live in [`pipeline/sample-inputs/`](pipeline/sample-inputs) and are
public, permissively-licensed stand-ins — **no customer data or proprietary code**:

- **`forms/`** — an Oracle Forms retail application (6 `.fmb` modules + DDL). Source:
  [oracle-retail-management-system](https://github.com/v7med7elmy-ai/oracle-retail-management-system)
  (MIT).
- **`apex/opportunities.sql`** — an Oracle APEX "Opportunity Tracking" sample application
  (Oracle UPL v1.0).

Oracle schema owners used by the sample are `apex_sample` (APEX tables) and `app_data`
(application data). See [THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES](THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES).

## Security

- **No credentials in code.** The .NET API and pipeline read connection details and secrets
  from environment variables / **AWS Secrets Manager** (`.env` is git-ignored; see
  `.env.example`).
- The Angular SPA is served over **HTTPS via CloudFront**; the API is reached **same-origin**
  through a CloudFront `/api/*` reverse-proxy (no mixed content, no CORS).
- Sample IAM is scoped for a **non-production** account. Review and tighten before real use.
- No production data is used anywhere; the legacy inputs are public stand-ins.

See [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md#security-issue-notifications) for reporting security issues.

## Cost

This sample provisions billable resources: **Amazon OpenSearch Serverless** (the largest
continuous cost), **Bedrock** inference (per token), **ECS Fargate**, **EC2** (Oracle XE),
**CloudFront**, and **S3**. Run [`scripts/cleanup.sh`](scripts/cleanup.sh) when you are done.

## Cleanup

```bash
./scripts/cleanup.sh          # cdk destroy --all + empties the S3 buckets
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Bedrock "model identifier is invalid" / on-demand not supported** — use an **inference
  profile** ARN (e.g. `us.anthropic.claude-...`), not a bare model id, and enable the model in
  your region.
- **OpenSearch Serverless 401 on KB ingestion** — check the collection's **network policy**
  (`AllowFromPublic`) and data-access policy principals.
- **Angular blank page (NG0908)** — ensure `angular.json` build options include
  `"polyfills": ["zone.js"]`.
- **Mixed-content / CORS errors** — confirm CloudFront is proxying `/api/*` to the ALB and the
  SPA uses a same-origin (empty) API base URL.
